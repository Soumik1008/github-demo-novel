In the spring of 1922, Nick takes a house in the fictional village of West Egg on Long Island, where he finds himself 
living among the colossal mansions of the newly rich. Across the water in the more refined village of East Egg live his 
cousin Daisy and her brutish, absurdly wealthy husband Tom Buchanan. Early in the summer Nick goes over to their house 
for dinner, where he also meets Jordan Baker, a friend of Daisy’s and a well-known golf champion, who tells him that Tom
has a mistress in New York City. In a private conversation, Daisy confesses to Nick that she has been unhappy. Returning
to his house in West Egg, he catches sight of his neighbour, Jay Gatsby, standing alone in the dark and stretching his
arms out to a green light burning across the bay at the end of Tom and Daisy’s dock.

Early in July Tom introduces Nick to his mistress, Myrtle Wilson, who lives with her spiritless husband George Wilson in
what Nick calls “a valley of ashes”: an industrial wasteland presided over by the bespectacled eyes of Doctor T.J. 
Eckleburg, which stare down from an advertising billboard. Meeting her at the garage where George works as a repairman,
the three of them go to Tom and Myrtle’s apartment in Manhattan. They are joined by Myrtle’s sister and some other 
friends who live nearby, and the evening ends in heavy drunkenness and Tom punching Myrtle in the nose when she brings
up Daisy. Nick wakes up in a train station the morning afterward.
